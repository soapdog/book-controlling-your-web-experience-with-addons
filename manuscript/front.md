## This book is in perpetual beta

My plan is to update this book often, expanding its contents and revising the text as issues are found by readers. Since the WebExtensions API is evolving constantly, you will want to make sure you're reading an up-to-date version of this book.

Also, always check the **version history** section because it lists what changed and has important information about decisions made before releasing each book update.

## Me, myself, and I

In this book you will find many parts where I express my personal opinion and make decisions that may be different from what other programmers would do - particularly if it helps explain an idea more easily. I will always try to make it clear and explain my reasoning when I am giving my opinion. Anyway, if there is an error in what I am saying, I will revise the text and update the book. See the Feedback & Pull Requests section for more information.

## Who should read this book

This book is written for readers with an intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript who wants to take back the control of their web experience, people who wonder why a website is this way and not that way or that would love just to inject a bit of js here and there.

## Best Practices vs Beginner Friendliness

Experienced developers will notice that sometimes I don't follow all the good practices in the source code of the examples of this book. Even though I am avoiding anti-patterns in here, I am trying to keep the use of immediate functions and other similar practices to a minimum. The main reason for that is to make the source code beginner friendly as this is an introductory book. Seasoned programmers will know when and how to change things while beginner coders will still be able to understand what is going on. All code here works and as I update this book I may revisit the code and use more and more best practices depending on the readers feedback.

If you want to dive deeper in the world of high quality JavaScript coding here are some good books:

* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do): The JavaScript Book.
* [JavaScript Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do): Patterns and best practices.
* [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do): Advanced JavaScript techniques.
* [Maintainable JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do): Writing code that is easy to maintain and work with.
* [Javascript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge): a wonderful book that makes you look to JS with a functional programming lens. You'll learn more about functions, combinators, decorators and all the cool stuff that you can do in our favorite web language.
