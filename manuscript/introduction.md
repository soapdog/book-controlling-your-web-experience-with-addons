# Loosing control
The Web is as mainstream as possible these days yet, most of its users have a very passive approach to their online experience as they approach web technology as if it was a black box best not tampered with. The average web user believes that there are only two possible actions on the Web[^1]:

* To browse someones site.
* To create your own site.

And since most people spend more time browsing other peoples site then they do creating their own, the overall experience of web users is a quite uninvolved one much like cable TV or video games. By uninvolved I don't mean that it is not interactive, I mean that you don't have a say or a way to influence the interactivity of that experience at first glance. If people restrict themselves to whatever experience they are given by the content producer, they will never become content producers themselves.

The last decade of the Web has been marked by one upward trend in siloed experiences. Our online experience becomes more centralized and controlled each day and [many people actually believe that facebook is all there is on the web](http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/).

> A small-scale survey in five countries showed that many Facebook users either donâ€™t know the app is on the Internet, or have no idea there is an Internet beyond Facebook. Without Web literacy, we cannot expect people to understand what the Internet can do for them, or why they should care. &mdash; from [Mozilla Internet Health Report v0.1 - Web Literacy](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/web-literacy/)
